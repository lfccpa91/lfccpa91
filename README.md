- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler Searle
- ğŸ‘€ Outside of work/development Iâ€™m interested in Liverpool Football Club (#ynwa), reading books, and spending time outdoors with my family.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to figure out where to focus.  I've done a bit of python programming, but am interested in web development as well.
