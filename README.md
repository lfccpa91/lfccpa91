- 👋 Hi, I’m Tyler Searle
- 👀 Outside of work/development I’m interested in Liverpool Football Club (#ynwa), reading books, and spending time outdoors with my family.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to figure out where to focus.  I've done a bit of python programming, but am interested in web development as well,and am working through The Odin Project to learn more.
